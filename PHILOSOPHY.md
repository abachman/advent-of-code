my philosophy and how i approach Advent of Code, in case it's helpful to anyone else: 

1. this is for fun. if it's not fun anymore it's okay to stop any time.
2. your way of working is fine. what other people post and how quickly they do is not a measure of your worth.
3. this is the "craft" part of programming. like knitting or woodworking, it's okay to make mistakes and take your time, to set down a project when another one looks more interesting, to make something that's not perfect. it's okay to make something that's just for you.
4. there is no "cheating" unless you're chasing the global leaderboard, everything else is a constraint you give yourself because constraints are interesting and fun.
5. like anything that crosses over into social media territory, people tend to post their wins. whatever makes them look good. what you see in a repo, on hackernews, on reddit, on mastodon, on slack, is peoples' work through a filter, at the end of a process of trying things and then cleaning up.
