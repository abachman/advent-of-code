# --- Day 18: Like a GIF For Your Yard ---
#
# After the million lights incident, the fire code has gotten stricter: now, at
# most ten thousand lights are allowed. You arrange them in a 100x100 grid.
#
# Never one to let you down, Santa again mails you instructions on the ideal
# lighting configuration. With so few lights, he says, you'll have to resort to
# animation.
#
# Start by setting your lights to the included initial configuration (your
# puzzle input). A # means "on", and a . means "off".
#
# Then, animate your grid in steps, where each step decides the next
# configuration based on the current one. Each light's next state (either on or
# off) depends on its current state and the current states of the eight lights
# adjacent to it (including diagonals). Lights on the edge of the grid might
# have fewer than eight neighbors; the missing ones always count as "off".
#
# For example, in a simplified 6x6 grid, the light marked A has the neighbors
# numbered 1 through 8, and the light marked B, which is on an edge, only has
# the neighbors marked 1 through 5:
#
#   1B5...
#   234...
#   ......
#   ..123.
#   ..8A4.
#   ..765.
#
# The state a light should have next is based on its current state (on or off)
# plus the number of neighbors that are on:
#
# - A light which is on stays on when 2 or 3 neighbors are on, and turns off
#   otherwise.
# - A light which is off turns on if exactly 3 neighbors are on, and stays off
#   otherwise.
# - All of the lights update simultaneously; they all consider the same current
#   state before moving to the next.
#
# Here's a few steps from an example configuration of another 6x6 grid:
#
# Initial state:
#
#   .#.#.#
#   ...##.
#   #....#
#   ..#...
#   #.#..#
#   ####..
#
# After 1 step:
#
#   ..##..
#   ..##.#
#   ...##.
#   ......
#   #.....
#   #.##..
#
# After 2 steps:
#
#   ..###.
#   ......
#   ..###.
#   ......
#   .#....
#   .#....
#
# After 3 steps:
#
#   ...#..
#   ......
#   ...#..
#   ..##..
#   ......
#   ......
#
# After 4 steps:
#
#   ......
#   ......
#   ..##..
#   ..##..
#   ......
#   ......
#
# After 4 steps, this example has four lights on.
#
# In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, how many
# lights are on after 100 steps?
#
# --- Part Two ---
#
# You flip the instructions over; Santa goes on to point out that this is all
# just an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. At least, it was, until you
# notice that something's wrong with the grid of lights you bought: four
# lights, one in each corner, are stuck on and can't be turned off. The example
# above will actually run like this:
#
#  ...
#
# After 5 steps, this example now has 17 lights on.
#
# In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, but with
# the four corners always in the on state, how many lights are on after 100
# steps?
